            This is your room in words. <br/>
            It's really small and nice. You are free to spend there as much time as you wish (if you wish for any second
            there, of course). <br/>
            There are a lot of things you might or mingt not need over there: table, few chairs, window, vase, a few
            working lamps and some more mess with random things you should not read about here: better see it with your
            eyes later.<br/>
            Good luck!
